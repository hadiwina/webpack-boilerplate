# Webpack Boilerplate

This is an easy way to create a boilerplate for a simple application that has webpack configured for development purposes. [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) was added so that changes to the code is observed and will automatically trigger a browser refresh.

To use:
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies `$ npm i`

To run local server of the app:

`$ npx webpack serve`
